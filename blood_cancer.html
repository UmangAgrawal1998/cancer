<a id="overview">
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>
<p>Leukemia, also spelled leukaemia, is a group of cancers that usually begin in the bone marrow and result in high numbers of abnormal white blood cells.These white blood cells are not fully developed and are called blasts or leukemia cells.Symptoms may include bleeding and bruising problems, feeling tired, fever, and an increased risk of infections.These symptoms occur due to a lack of normal blood cells.Diagnosis is typically made by blood tests or bone marrow biopsy.</p>
</p>
</a>
<a id="diagnosis">
<h2>DIAGNOSIS</h2>
<p>
<p>Diagnosis is usually based on repeated complete blood counts and a bone marrow examination following observations of the symptoms. Sometimes, blood tests may not show that a person has leukemia, especially in the early stages of the disease or during remission. A lymph node biopsy can be performed to diagnose certain types of leukemia in certain situations.</p>
<p>Following diagnosis, blood chemistry tests can be used to determine the degree of liver and kidney damage or the effects of chemotherapy on the patient. When concerns arise about other damage due to leukemia, doctors may use an X-ray, MRI, or ultrasound. These can potentially show leukemia's effects on such body parts as bones (X-ray), the brain (MRI), or the kidneys, spleen, and liver (ultrasound). CT scans can be used to check lymph nodes in the chest, though this is uncommon.</p>
<p>Despite the use of these methods to diagnose whether or not a patient has leukemia, many people have not been diagnosed because many of the symptoms are vague, non-specific, and can refer to other diseases. For this reason, the American Cancer Society estimates that at least one-fifth of the people with leukemia have not yet been diagnosed.</p>

<a id="types">
<h2>TYPES</h2>
<p>
<p>The types of leukemia</p>
<ul>
<li>Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of leukemia in young children. It also affects adults, especially those 65 and older. Standard treatments involve chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The survival rates vary by age: 85% in children and 50% in adults. Subtypes include precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, precursor T acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt's leukemia, and acute biphenotypic leukemia.</li>
<li>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) most often affects adults over the age of 55. It sometimes occurs in younger adults, but it almost never affects children. Two-thirds of affected people are men. The five-year survival rate is 75%. It is incurable, but there are many effective treatments. One subtype is B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia, a more aggressive disease.</li>
<li>Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) occurs more commonly in adults than in children, and more commonly in men than women. It is treated with chemotherapy. The five-year survival rate is 40%, except for APL (Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia), which has a survival rate greater than 90%.Subtypes of AML include acute promyelocytic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, and acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.</li>
<li>Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) occurs mainly in adults; a very small number of children also develop this disease. It is treated with imatinib (Gleevec in United States, Glivec in Europe) or other drugs. The five-year survival rate is 90%. One subtype is chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.</li>
<li>Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is sometimes considered a subset of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but does not fit neatly into this category. About 80% of affected people are adult men. No cases in children have been reported. HCL is incurable but easily treatable. Survival is 96% to 100% at ten years.</li>
<li>T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) is a very rare and aggressive leukemia affecting adults; somewhat more men than women are diagnosed with this disease.Despite its overall rarity, it is the most common type of mature T cell leukemia;nearly all other leukemias involve B cells. It is difficult to treat, and the median survival is measured in months.</li>
<li>Large granular lymphocytic leukemia may involve either T-cells or NK cells; like hairy cell leukemia, which involves solely B cells, it is a rare and indolent (not aggressive) leukemia.</li>
<li>Adult T-cell leukemia is caused by human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV), a virus similar to HIV. Like HIV, HTLV infects CD4+ T-cells and replicates within them; however, unlike HIV, it does not destroy them. Instead, HTLV "immortalizes" the infected T-cells, giving them the ability to proliferate abnormally. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus types I and II (HTLV-I/II) are endemic in certain areas of the world.</li>
<li>Clonal eosinophilias are caused by acquired genetic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells that leads to, or are associated with, a form of chronic eosinophilic leukemia or various forms of myeloid neoplasms, lymphoid neoplasms, myelofibrosis, or the myelodysplastic syndrome. The latter forms of clonal eosinophilia are commonly associated with blood or tissue eosinophilia.</li>
</ul>

<a id="causes">
<h2>CAUSES</h2>
<p>
<p>Radiation</p>
<p>Large doses of Sr-90 emission from nuclear reactors, nicknamed bone seeker increases the risk of bone cancer and leukemia in animals, and is presumed to do so in people.</p>
<p>Genetic conditions</p>
<p>Some people have a genetic predisposition towards developing leukemia. This predisposition is demonstrated by family histories and twin studies.[32] The affected people may have a single gene or multiple genes in common. In some cases, families tend to develop the same kinds of leukemia as other members; in other families, affected people may develop different forms of leukemia or related blood cancers.In addition to these genetic issues, people with chromosomal abnormalities or certain other genetic conditions have a greater risk of leukemia.[33] For example, people with Down syndrome have a significantly increased risk of developing forms of acute leukemia (especially acute myeloid leukemia), and Fanconi anemia is a risk factor for developing acute myeloid leukemia.Mutation in SPRED1 gene has been associated with a predisposition to childhood leukemia.</p>
<p>Non-ionizing radiation</p>
<p>Whether or not non-ionizing radiation causes leukemia has been studied for several decades. The International Agency for Research on Cancer expert working group undertook a detailed review of all data on static and extremely low frequency electromagnetic energy, which occurs naturally and in association with the generation, transmission, and use of electrical power.They concluded that there is limited evidence that high levels of ELF magnetic (but not electric) fields might cause some cases of childhood leukemia.</p>

<a id="symptoms">
<h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Fever or chills</li>
<li>Persistent fatigue, weakness</li>
<li>Frequent or severe infections</li>
<li>Losing weight without trying</li>
<li>Swollen lymph nodes, enlarged liver or spleen</li>
<li>Easy bleeding or bruising</li>
<li>Recurrent nosebleeds</li>
<li>Tiny red spots in your skin (petechiae)</li>
<li>Excessive sweating, especially at night</li>
<li>Bone pain or tenderness</li>
</ul>
</p>
</a>
<a id="treatment">
<h2>TREATMENT</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Biological therapy. Biological therapy works by using treatments that help your immune system recognize and attack leukemia cells.</li>
<li>Targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs that attack specific vulnerabilities within your cancer cells. For example, the drug imatinib (Gleevec) stops the action of a protein within the leukemia cells of people with chronic myelogenous leukemia. This can help control the disease.</li>
<li>Radiation therapy. Radiation therapy uses X-rays or other high-energy beams to damage leukemia cells and stop their growth. During radiation therapy, you lie on a table while a large machine moves around you, directing the radiation to precise points on your body.You may receive radiation in one specific area of your body where there is a collection of leukemia cells, or you may receive radiation over your whole body. Radiation therapy may be used to prepare for a stem cell transplant.</li>
<li>Stem cell transplant. A stem cell transplant is a procedure to replace your diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow.Before a stem cell transplant, you receive high doses of chemotherapy or radiation therapy to destroy your diseased bone marrow. Then you receive an infusion of blood-forming stem cells that help to rebuild your bone marrow.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a id="stages">
<h2>STAGES</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Stage 1: The blood cancer 1st stage includes the enlargement of the lymph nodes. This happens because of the sudden increase of the number of the lymphocytes. The risk at this stage is very low as the cancer is not yet spread or affected any other physical organ.</li>
<li>Stage 2: In the blood cancer 2nd stage, spleen, liver and lymph nodes get enlarged. It is not necessary that all these organs get affected at the same time; however, this stage includes one of these organs for sure. The growth of the lymphocytes is very high in this stage.</li>
<li>Stage 3: In the blood cancer 3rd stage, anaemia develops in the third stage and above mentioned organs are still found enlarged. It is sure that more than two organs get affected in this stage.</li>
<li>Stage 4: The blood cancer 4th stage is the last stage with the highest risk ratio. The rate of blood platelets starts falling rapidly. The cancerous cells start affecting the lungs including the other organs which already started getting affected in the earlier stages. Anaemia, in this stage, is more likely to be acute.</li>
</ul>
