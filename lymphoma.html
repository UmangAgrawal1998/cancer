<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>
<p>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas.Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and tiredness. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing.</p>
<p>Lymphomas are types of cancer that develop from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Risk factors include poor immune function, autoimmune diseases, Helicobacter pylori infection, hepatitis C, obesity, and Epstein-Barr virus infection.The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies lymphomas into five major groups, including one for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Within the four groups for NHL there are over 60 specific types of lymphoma.Diagnosis is by examination of a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Medical imaging is done to help with cancer staging.</p>
</p>
</a>
<a id="diagnosis">
<h2>DIAGNOSIS</h2>
<p>Tests and procedures used to diagnose non-Hodgkin's lymphoma include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical examination. Your doctor may conduct a physical exam to determine the size and condition of your lymph nodes and to find out whether your liver and spleen are enlarged.</li>
<li>Blood and urine tests. Blood and urine tests may help rule out an infection or other disease.</li>
<li>Imaging tests. Your doctor may recommend imaging tests to look for tumors in your body. Imaging tests may include X-ray, computerized tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET).</li>
<li>Removing a sample of lymph node tissue for testing. Your doctor may recommend a biopsy procedure to sample or remove a lymph node for testing. Analyzing lymph node tissue in a lab may reveal whether you have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and, if so, which type.</li>
<li>Looking for cancer cells in your bone marrow. To find out whether the disease affects your bone marrow, your doctor may request a bone marrow biopsy. This involves inserting a needle into your pelvic bone to obtain a sample of bone marrow.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</a>
<a id="types">
<h2>TYPES</h2>
<P>
<p>Lymphomas are often described as B-cell lymphomas or T-cell lymphomas according to whether they began in B-cell lymphocytes or T-cell lymphocytes.</p>
<p>Type of B-cell lymphomas:</p>
<ul>
<li>diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)</li>
<li>follicular lymphoma (FL)</li>
</ul>
<p>Other less common types include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burkitt lymphoma</li>
<li>MALT lymphoma (extranodal marginal zone B-cell)</li>
<li>lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (also called Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinaemia)</li>
<li>mantle cell lymphoma</li>
<li>mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma</li>
<li>nodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma</li>
<li>small lymphocytic lymphoma</li>
<li>thyroid lymphoma</li>
</ul>
<p>T-cell lymphomas  are much less common. There are a number of different types, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>peripheral T-cell lymphoma</li>
<li>skin (cutaneous) lymphomas, including Mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome</li>
<li>anaplastic large cell lymphoma</li>
<li>T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma</li>
</ul>
</p>
</a>
<a id="causes">
<h2>CAUSES</h2>
<p>
<p>Infectious agents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epstein-Barr virus: associated with Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, follicular dendritic cell sarcoma, extranodal NK-T-cell lymphoma</li>
<li>Human T-cell leukemia virus: associated with adult T-cell lymphoma</li>
<li>Helicobacter pylori: associated with gastric lymphoma</li>
<li>HHV-8: associated with primary effusion lymphoma, multicentric Castleman disease</li>
<li>Hepatitis C virus: associated with splenic marginal zone lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma</li>
<li>HIV infection</li>
</ul>
<p>Some chemicals, like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),diphenylhydantoin, dioxin, and phenoxy herbicides.</p>
<p>Medical treatments, like radiation therapy and chemotherapy</p>
<p>Genetic diseases, like Klinefelter's syndrome, Chédiak-Higashi syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia syndrome</p>
<p>Autoimmune diseases, like Sjögren’s syndrome, celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.</p>
</p>
</a>
<a id="symptoms">
<h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
<p>
<p>Some common signs and symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enlarged lymph nodes</li>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Sweating and chills</li>
<li>Weight loss</li>
<li>Fatigue (extreme tiredness)</li>
<li>Swollen abdomen (belly)</li>
<li>Feeling full after only a small amount of food</li>
<li>Chest pain or pressure</li>
<li>Shortness of breath or cough</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma often causes general symptoms, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fever</li>
<li>Sweating and chills, especially at night</li>
<li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
<li>Feeling very tired</li>
<li>Severe or frequent infections</li>
<li>Easy bruising or bleeding</li>
</ul>
</p>
</a>
<a id="treatment">
<h2>TREATMENT</h2>
<p>
<p>Chemo is the main treatment for most people with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Depending on the type and the stage of the lymphoma, chemo may be used alone or combined with other treatments, such as immunotherapy drugs or radiation therapy.</p>
</p>
</a>
<a id="stages">
<h2>STAGES</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Stage I:Either of the following means the disease is stage I-</li>
<ul>
<li>The lymphoma is in only 1 lymph node area or lymphoid organ such as the tonsils (I).</li>
<li>The cancer is found only in 1 area of a single organ outside of the lymph system (IE).</li>
</ul>
<li>Stage II:Either of the following means the disease is stage II-</li>
<ul>
<li>The lymphoma is in 2 or more groups of lymph nodes on the same side of (above or below) the diaphragm (the thin band of muscle that separates the chest and abdomen). </li>
<li>The lymphoma is in a group of lymph node(s) and in one area of a nearby organ (IIE). It may also affect other groups of lymph nodes on the same side of the diaphragm.</li>
</ul>
<li>Stage III:Either of the following means the disease is stage III-</li>
<ul>
<li>The lymphoma is in lymph node areas on both sides of (above and below) the diaphragm.</li>
<li>The lymphoma is in lymph nodes above the diaphragm, as well as in the spleen.</li>
</ul>
<li>Stage IV: The lymphoma has spread widely into at least one organ outside the lymph system, such as the bone marrow, liver, or lung.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a id="expert tips of prevention">
<h2>EXPERT TIPS OF PREVENTION</h2>
<p>NHL risk factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Having an inherited immune disorder known as Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome</li>
<li>Having HIV/AIDS</li>
<li>Taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant</li>
<li>Past radiation treatment</li>
<li>Having a relative with Lymphoma or Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</li>
</ul>
<p>prevention</p>
<p> Infection with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is known to increase the risk NHL, so one way to limit your risk is to avoid known risk factors for HIV, such as intravenous drug use or unprotected sex with many partners. You can read more about HIV infection in HIV, AIDS, and Cancer.</p>
<p>Preventing the spread of the human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-1) could have a great impact on non-Hodgkin lymphoma in areas of the world where this virus is common, such as Japan and the Caribbean region. The virus is rare in the United States but seems to be increasing in some areas. The same strategies used to prevent HIV spread could also help control HTLV-1.</p>
<p>Helicobacter pylori infection has been linked to some lymphomas of the stomach. Treating H. pylori infections with antibiotics and antacids may lower this risk, but the benefit of this strategy has not been proven yet. Most people with H. pylori infection have no symptoms, and some have only mild heartburn. More research is needed to find the best way to detect and treat this infection in people without symptoms.</p>
<p>Some lymphomas are caused by treatment of other cancers with radiation and chemotherapy or by the use of immune-suppressing drugs to avoid rejection of transplanted organs. Doctors are trying to find better ways to treat cancer and organ transplant patients without increasing the risk of lymphoma as much. But for now, the benefits of these treatments still usually outweigh the small risk of developing lymphoma many years later.</p>
<p>Some studies have suggested that being overweight or obese may increase your risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Other studies have suggested that a diet high in fat and meats may raise your risk. Staying at a healthy weight and eating a healthy diet may help protect against lymphoma, but more research is needed to confirm this.</p>
