<h2><b><u><a id="overview">OVERVIEW</a></u></b></h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
Breast cancer is a malignant tumor (a collection of cancer cells) arising from the cells of the breast. Although breast cancer predominantly occurs in women, it can also affect men. This article deals with breast cancer in women.Worldwide, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed life-threatening cancer in women. <br>In less-developed countries, it is the leading cause of cancer death in women; in developed countries, however, it has been surpassed by lung cancer as a cause of cancer death in women. <br>[1] In the United States, breast cancer accounts for 29% of all cancers in women and is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer deaths.<br> [2] (For discussion of male breast cancer, see Breast Cancer in Men.)<br>
Many early breast carcinomas are asymptomatic; pain or discomfort is not usually a symptom of breast cancer. Breast cancer is often first detected as an abnormality on a mammogram before it is felt by the patient or healthcare provider.
The general approach to evaluation of breast cancer has become formalized as triple assessment: clinical examination, imaging (usually mammography, ultrasonography, or both), and needle biopsy. (See Workup.) Increased public awareness and improved screening have led to earlier diagnosis, at stages amenable to complete surgical resection and curative therapies. Improvements in therapy and screening have led to improved survival rates for women diagnosed with breast cancer.<br>
Surgery and radiation therapy, along with adjuvant hormone or chemotherapy when indicated, are now considered primary treatment for breast cancer. For many patients with low-risk early-stage breast cancer, surgery with local radiation is curative. (See Treatment.)<br>
Adjuvant breast cancer therapies are designed to treat micrometastatic disease or breast cancer cells that have escaped the breast and regional lymph nodes but do not yet have an established identifiable metastasis.<br> Depending on the model of risk reduction, adjuvant therapy has been estimated to be responsible for 35-72% of the decrease in mortality.
Over the past 3 decades, extensive and advocate-driven breast cancer research has led to extraordinary progress in the understanding of the disease. This has resulted in the development of more targeted and less toxic treatments. (See Treatment and Medication.)
</p>
<h2><b><u><a id="types">TYPES</a></u></b></h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px" >
There are many types of breast cancer. Some are more common than others, and there are also combinations of cancers. Some of the most common types of cancer are as follows:<br>

<u>Ductal carcinoma in situ</u>: The most common type of noninvasive breast cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This type of cancer has not spread and therefore usually has a very high cure rate.<br>
<u>Invasive ductal carcinoma</u>: This cancer starts in a duct of the breast and grows into the surrounding tissue. It is the most common form of breast cancer. About 80% of invasive breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinoma.<br>
<u>Invasive lobular carcinoma</u>: This breast cancer starts in the glands of the breast that produce milk. Approximately 10% of invasive breast cancers are invasive lobular carcinoma.<br>
The remainder of breast cancers are much less common and include the following:<br>
Mucinous carcinoma are formed from mucus-producing cancer cells. Mixed tumors contain a variety of cell types.<br>
Medullary carcinoma is an infiltrating breast cancer that presents with well-defined boundaries between the cancerous and noncancerous tissue.<br>
<u>Inflammatory breast cancer</u>: This cancer makes the skin of the breast appear red and feel warm (giving it the appearance of an infection). These changes are due to the blockage of lymph vessels by cancer cells.<br>
<u>Triple-negative breast cancers</u>: This is a subtype of invasive cancer with cells that lack estrogen and progesterone receptors and have no excess of a specific protein (HER2) on their surface. It tends to appear more often in younger women and African-American women.<br>
Paget's disease of the nipple: This cancer starts in the ducts of the breast and spreads to the nipple and the area surrounding the nipple. It usually presents with crusting and redness around the nipple.<br>
<u>Adenoid cystic carcinoma</u>: These cancers have both glandular and cystic features. They tend not to spread aggressively and have a good prognosis.<br>
<u>Lobular carcinoma in situ</u>: This is not a cancer but an area of abnormal cell growth that can lead to invasive breast cancer later in life.<br>


The following are other uncommon types of breast cancer:<br>
Papillary carcinoma<br>
Phyllodes tumor<br>
Angiosarcoma<br>

</p>

<h2><b><u><a id="causes">CAUSES</a></u></b></h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
There are many risk factors that increase the chance of developing breast cancer. Although we know some of these risk factors, we don't know the cause of breast cancer2or how these factors cau2e the development of a cancer cell.
We know that normal breast cells become cancerous because of mutations in the DNA, and although some of these are inherited, most DNA changes related to breast cells are acquired during one's life.
Proto-oncogenes help cells grow. If these cells mutate, they can increase growth of cells without any control. Such mutations are referred to as oncogenes. Such uncontrolled cell growth can lead to cancer.
RISK FACTORS:
Several risk factors are inconclusive (such as deodorants), while in other areas, the risk is being even more clearly defined (such as alcohol use).
The following are risk factors for breast cancer:<br>
1) <u>Age</u>: The chances of breast cancer increase as one gets older.<br>
2) <u>Family history</u>: The risk of breast cancer is higher among women who have relatives with the disease. Having a close relative with the disease (sister, mother, daughter) doubles a woman's risk.<br>
3)<u> Personal history</u>: Having been diagnosed with breast cancer in one breast increases the risk of cancer in the other breast or the chance of an additional cancer in the original breast.<br>
4) Women diagnosed with certain benign breast conditions have an increased risk of breast cancer. These include atypical hyperplasia, a condition in which there is abnormal proliferation of breast cells but no cancer has developed.<br>
5) <u>Menstruation</u>: Women who started their menstrual cycle at a younger age (before 12) or went through menopause later (after 55) have a slightly increased risk.<br>
6) <u>Breast tissue</u>: Women with dense breast tissue (as documented by mammogram) have a higher risk of breast cancer.<br>
7)<u> Race</u>: White women have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, but African-American women tend to have more aggressive tumors when they do develop breast cancer.<br>
8) Exposure to previous chest radiation or use of diethylstilbestrol increases the risk of breast cancer.
Having no children or the first child after age 30 increases the risk of breast cancer.<br>
9) Breastfeeding for one and a half to two years might slightly lower the risk of breast cancer. <br>
10) Being overweight or obese increases the risk of breast cancer both in pre- and postmenopausal women but at different rates.<br>
11) Use of oral contraceptives in the last 10 years increases the risk of breast cancer slightly.<br>
12) Using combined hormone therapy after menopause increases the risk of breast cancer.<br>
13) Alcohol use increases the risk of breast cancer, and this seems to be proportional to the amount of alcohol used. A recent study reviewing the research on alcohol use and breast cancer concluded that all levels of alcohol use are associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. This includes even light drinking.<br>
14) Exercise seems to lower the risk of breast cancer.<br>
15) Genetic risk factors: The most common causes are mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (breast cancer and ovarian cancer genes). Inheriting a mutated gene from a parent means that one has a significantly higher risk of developing breast cancer.

<h2><u><a id="symptoms"><b>SYMPTOMS</b></a></u></h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
The general symptoms are:<br>
1)<u>	A Change In How The Breast Or Nipple Feels: </u><br>
Nipple tenderness or a lump or thickening in or near the breast or underarm area. A change in the skin texture or an enlargement of pores in the skin of the breast (some describe this as similar to an orange peel’s texture). A lump in the breast (It’s important to remember that all lumps should be investigated by a healthcare professional, but not all lumps are cancerous.)<br>
2)	<u>A Change In The Breast Or Nipple Appearance</u><br>
Any unexplained change in the size or shape of the breast	<br>
Dimpling anywhere on the breast<br>
Unexplained swelling of the breast (especially if on one side only)<br>
Unexplained shrinkage of the breast (especially if on one side only)<br>
Recent asymmetry of the breasts (Although it is common for women to have one breast that is slightly larger than the other, if the onset of asymmetry is recent, it should be checked.)<br>
Nipple that is turned slightly inward or inverted<br>
Skin of the breast, areola, or nipple that becomes scaly, red, or swollen or may have ridges or pitting resembling the skin of an orange<br>
3)	<u>Any Nipple Discharge—Particularly Clear Discharge Or Bloody Discharge</u><br>
It is also important to note that a milky discharge that is present when a woman is not breastfeeding should be checked by her doctor, although it is not linked with breast cancer.<br>
</p>

<h1><u><a id="stages"><b>STAGES</b></a></u></h1>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
Staging is the process of determining the extent of the cancer and its spread in the body. Together with the type of cancer, staging is used to determine the appropriate therapy and to predict chances for survival.<br>
To determine if the cancer has spread, several different imaging techniques can be used.<br>
<u>Chest X-ray</u>: It looks for spread of the cancer to the lung.<br>
<u>Mammograms</u>: More detailed and additional mammograms provide more images of the breast and may locate other abnormalities.<br>
<u>Computerized tomography (CT scan)</u>: These specialized X-rays are used to look at different parts of your body to determine if the breast cancer has spread. It could include a CT of the brain, lungs, or any other area of concern.<br>
<u>Bone scan</u>: A bone scan determines if the cancer has spread (metastasized) to the bones. Low level radioactive material is injected into the bloodstream, and over a few hours, images are taken to determine if there is uptake in certain bone areas, indicating metastasis.<br>
<u>Positron emission tomography</u> (PET scan): A radioactive material is injected that is absorbed preferentially by rapidly growing cells (such as cancer cells). The PET scanner then locates these areas in your body.
Staging system<br>
This system is used by a health care team to summarize in a standard way the extent and spread of the cancer. This staging can then be used to determine the treatment most appropriate for the type of cancer.<br>
The most widely used system in the U.S. is the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM system. A new eighth edition of this staging system has been developed for 2018 that includes results of testing for certain biomarkers, including the HER2 protein and the results of gene expression assays, in addition to the factors (TNM) described below.<br>
Besides the information gained from the imaging tests, this system also uses the results from surgical procedures. After surgery, a pathologist looks at the cells from the breast cancer as well as from the lymph nodes. This information gained is incorporated into the staging as it tends to be more accurate than the physical exam and X-ray findings alone.<br>
<u>TNM staging</u> This system uses letters and numbers to describe certain tumor characteristics in a uniform manner. This allows health care providers to stage the cancer (which helps determine the most appropriate therapy) and aids communication among health care providers.<br>
T: This describes the size of the tumor. It is followed by a number from 0 to 4. Higher numbers indicate a larger tumor or greater spread:<br>
TX: Primary tumor cannot be assessed<br>
T0: No evidence of primary tumor<br>
Tis: Carcinoma in situ<br>
T1: Tumor is 2 cm or less across<br>
T2: Tumor is 2 cm-5 cm<br>
T3: Tumor is more than 5 cm<br>
T4: Tumor of any size growing into the chest wall or skin<br>
N: This describes the spread to lymph node near the breast. It is followed by a number from 0 to 3.<br>
NX: Nearby lymph nodes cannot be assessed (for example if they have previously been removed).N0: There has been no spread to nearby lymph nodes. In addition to the numbers, this part of the staging is modified by the designation "i+" if the cancer cells are only seen by immunohistochemistry (a special stain) and "mol+" if the cancer could only be found using PCR (special detection technique to detect cancer at the molecular level).<br>
N1: Cancer has spread to one to three axillary lymph nodes (underarm lymph nodes) or tiny amounts of cancer are found in internal mammary lymph nodes (lymph nodes near breastbone).<br>
N2: Cancer has spread to four to nine axillary lymph nodes or the cancer has enlarged the internal mammary lymph nodes.<br>
N3: Any of the conditions below<br>
Cancer has spread to 10 or more axillary lymph nodes with at least one cancer spread larger than 2 mm.<br>
Cancer has spread to lymph nodes under the clavicle with at least area of cancer spread greater than 2 mm.<br>
M: This letter is followed by a 0 or 1, indicating whether the cancer has spread to other organs.<br>
MX: Metastasis cannot be assessed.<br>
M0: No distant spread is found on imaging procedures or by physical exam.<br>
M1: Spread to other organs is present.<br>
Once the T, N, and M categories have been determined, they are combined into staging groups. There are five major staging groups, stage 0 to stage IV, which are subdivided into A and B, or A and B and C, depending on the underlying cancer and the T, N, and M scale.<br>
</p>

<h1><a id="diagnosis"><b><u>DIAGNOSIS</u></b></a></h1>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
Although breast cancer can be diagnosed by the above signs and symptoms, the use of screening mammography has made it possible to detect many of the cancers early before they cause any symptoms.

The American Cancer Society (ACS) has the following recommendations for breast cancer screenings:
Women should have the opportunity to begin annual screening between 40-44 years of age. Women age 45 and older should have a screening mammogram every year until age 54. Women 55 years of age and older should have biennial screening or have the opportunity to continue screening annually. Women should continue screening mammography as long as their overall health is good and they have a life expectancy of 10 years or longer.
Mammograms are a very good screening tool for breast cancer. As in any test, mammograms have limitations and will miss some cancers. An individual's family history and mammogram and breast exam results should be discussed with a health-care provider.
The ACS does not recommend clinical screening exams in women of any age.
Women at high risk (greater than 20% lifetime risk) should get an MRI and a mammogram every year. Women at moderate risk (15%-20%) should talk to their doctor about the benefits and limitations of adding MRI screening to their yearly mammogram.
</p>

<h1><b><u><a id="treatment">TREATMENT</a></u></b></h1>
<p style="font-size: 25px">Patients with breast cancer have many treatment options. Most treatments are adjusted specifically to the type of cancer and the staging group. Treatment options are being adjusted frequently and your health care provider will have the information on the current standard of care available. Treatment options should be discussed with a health care team. The following are the basic treatment modalities used in the treatment of breast cancer.<br>

<u>Surgery</u><br>
Most women with breast cancer will require surgery. Broadly, the surgical therapies for breast cancer can be divided into breast-conserving surgery and mastectomy.<br>


<u>Breast-conserving surgery</u><br>
This surgery will only remove part of the breast (sometimes referred to as partial mastectomy). The extent of the surgery is determined by the size and location of the tumor.<br>

In a lumpectomy, only the breast lump and some surrounding tissue is removed. The surrounding tissue (surgical margins) are inspected for cancer cells. If no cancer cells are found, this is called "negative" or "clear margins." Frequently, radiation therapy is given after lumpectomies.<br>

<u>Mastectomy</u><br>
During a mastectomy (sometimes also referred to as a simple mastectomy), all the breast tissue is removed. If immediate reconstruction is considered, a skin-sparing mastectomy is sometimes performed. In this surgery, all the breast tissue is removed as well, but the overlying skin is preserved.<br>

<u>Radical mastectomy</u><br>
During this surgery, the surgeon removes the axillary lymph nodes as well as the chest wall muscle in addition to the breast. This procedure is done much less frequently than in the past, as in most cases, a modified radical mastectomy is as effective.<br>

<u>Modified radical mastectomy</u><br>
This surgery removes the axillary lymph nodes in addition to the breast tissue. Depending on the stage of the cancer, a health care team might give someone a choice between a lumpectomy and a mastectomy. Lumpectomy allows sparing of the breast but usually requires radiation therapy afterward. If lumpectomy is indicated, long-term follow-up shows no advantage of a mastectomy over the lumpectomy.<br>

<u>Preventive surgery</u><br>
For a small group of patients who have a very high risk of breast cancer, surgery to remove the breasts may be an option. Although this reduces the risk significantly, a small chance of developing cancer remains.
Double mastectomy is a surgical option to prevent breast cancer. This prophylactic (preventive) surgery can decrease the risk of breast cancer by about 90% for women at moderate to high risk for breast cancer.
Such an approach should be carefully discussed with a health care team.<br>



The discussion about whether to undergo any preventive surgery should include
genetic testing for BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutations,
full review of risk factors,
family history of cancer and specifically breast cancer, and
other preventive options such as medications.
Radiation therapy
Radiation therapy destroys cancer cells with high energy rays. There are two ways to administer radiation therapy.<br>

<u>External beam radiation</u><br>
This is the usual way radiation therapy is given for breast cancer. A beam of radiation is focused onto the affected area by an external machine. The extent of the treatment is determined by a health care team and is based on the surgical procedure performed and whether lymph nodes were affected or not.<br>

The local area will usually be marked after the radiation team has determined the exact location for the treatments. Usually, the treatment is given five days a week for five to six weeks.<br>

<u>Brachytherapy</u>
<br>This form of delivering radiation uses radioactive seeds or pellets. Instead of a beam from the outside delivering the radiation, these seeds are implanted into the breast next to the cancer.<br>

<u>Chemotherapy</u><br>
Chemotherapy is treatment of cancers with medications that travel through the bloodstream to the cancer cells. These medications are given either by intravenous injection or by mouth.<br>

Chemotherapy can have different indications and may be performed in different settings as follows:<br>

<u>Adjuvant chemotherapy</u>: If surgery has removed all the visible cancer, there is still the possibility that cancer cells have broken off or are left behind. If chemotherapy is given to assure that these small amounts of cells are killed as well, it is called adjunct chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is not given in all cases, since some women have a very low risk of recurrence even without chemotherapy, depending upon the tumor type and characteristics.<br>
<u>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy</u>: If chemotherapy is given before surgery, it is referred to as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Although there seems to be no advantage to long-term survival whether the therapy is given before or after surgery, there are advantages to see if the cancer responds to the therapy and by shrinking the cancer before surgical removal.<br>
<u>Chemotherapy for advanced cancer</u>: If the cancer has metastasized to distant sites in the body, chemotherapy can be used for treatment. With cases of metastatic breast cancer, the health-care team will need to determine the most appropriate length of treatment.<br>
There are many different chemotherapeutic agents that are either given alone or in combination. Usually, these drugs are given in cycles with certain treatment intervals followed by a rest period. The cycle length and rest intervals differ from drug to drug.<br>

<u>Hormone therapy</u><br>
This therapy is often used to help reduce the risk of cancer reoccurrence after surgery, but it can also be used as adjunct treatment.<br>

Estrogen (a hormone produced by the ovaries) promotes the growth of a few breast cancers, specifically those containing receptors for estrogen (ER positive) or progesterone (PR positive). The following drugs are used in hormone therapy:<br>

Tamoxifen (Nolvadex): This drug prevents estrogen from binding to estrogen receptors on breast cells.<br>
Toremifene (Fareston) works similar to Tamoxifen and is only indicated in metastatic breast cancer.<br>
Fulvestrant (Faslodex): This drug eliminates the estrogen receptor and can be used even if tamoxifen is no longer useful.<br>
Aromatase inhibitors: They stop estrogen production in postmenopausal women. Examples are letrozole (Femara), anastrozole (Arimidex), and exemestane (Aromasin).<br>
<u>Targeted therapy</u>
As we are learning more about gene changes and their involvement in causing cancer, drugs are being developed that specifically target the cancer cells. They tend to have fewer side effects than chemotherapy (as they target only the cancer cells) but usually are still used in adjunct with chemotherapy.<br>

<u>Alternative treatments</u><br>
Whenever a disease has the potential for much harm and death, physicians search for alternative treatments. As a patient or the loved one of a patient, there may be an inclination to try everything and leave no option unexplored. The danger in this approach is usually found in the fact that the patient might not avail themselves of existing, proven therapies. One should discuss any interest in alternative treatments with a health care team and together explore the different options.
</p>

<h2><u><a id="rate"><b>SURVIVAL RATE</b></u></a></h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
Survival rates are a way for health care professionals to discuss the prognosis and outlook of a cancer diagnosis with their patients. The number most frequently discussed is five-year survival. It is the percentage of patients who live at least five years after they are diagnosed with cancer. Many of these patients live much longer, and some patients die earlier from causes other than breast cancer. With a constant change in therapies, these numbers also change. The current five-year survival statistic is based on patients who were diagnosed at least five years ago and may have received different therapies than are available today. As with all statistics, although the numbers define outcomes for the group, any individual's outcome has the potential for a wide range of variation.
All of this needs to be taken into consideration when interpreting these numbers for oneself.
Below are the statistics from the National Cancer Institute's SEER database.

Stage	Five-year survival rate
0	100%
I	100%
II	93%
III	72%
IV	22%
These statistics are for all patients diagnosed and reported. Several recent studies have looked at different racial survival statistics and have found a higher mortality (death rate) in African-American women compared to white women in the same geographic area.
</p>

<h1><u><a id="expert"><b>EXPERT TIPS</b></a></u></h1>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
There is no guaranteed way to prevent breast cancer. Reviewing the risk factors and modifying the ones that can be altered (increase exercise, keep a good body weight, etc.) can help in decreasing the risk.
Following the American Cancer Society's guidelines for early detection can help early detection and treatment.
There are some subgroups of women that should consider additional preventive measures.
Women with a strong family history of breast cancer should be evaluated by genetic testing. This should be discussed with a health care provider and be preceded by a meeting with a genetic counselor who can explain what the testing can and cannot tell and then help interpret the results after testing.
Chemoprevention is the use of medications to reduce the risk of cancer. The two currently approved drugs for chemoprevention of breast cancer are tamoxifen (a medication that blocks estrogen effects on the breast tissue) and raloxifene (Evista), which also blocks the effect of estrogen on breast tissues. Their side effects and whether these medications are right for an individual need to be discussed with a health care provider.

Aromatase inhibitors are medications that block the production of small amounts of estrogen usually produced in postmenopausal women. They are being used to prevent reoccurrence of breast cancer but are not approved at this time for breast cancer chemoprevention.
For a small group of patients who have a very high risk of breast cancer, surgery to remove the breasts may be an option. Although this reduces the risk significantly, a small chance of developing cancer remains.
