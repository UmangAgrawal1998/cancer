<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>Pancreatic cancer is slightly more common in men than in women, usually occurring after age 45.Pancreatic cancer has a tendency to spread silently before diagnosis makes it one of the most deadly cancer diagnoses, with more than 43,000 people expected to die of the disease in 2017.Pancreatic cancer arises when cells in the pancreas, a glandular organ behind the stomach, begin to multiply out of control and form a mass. These cancerous cells have the ability to invade other parts of the body. There are a number of types of pancreatic cancer. The most common, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, accounts for about 85% of cases, and the term "pancreatic cancer" is sometimes used to refer only to that type.These adenocarcinomas start within the part of the pancreas which makes digestive enzymes. Several other types of cancer, which collectively represent the majority of the non-adenocarcinomas, can also arise from these cells. One to two percent of cases of pancreatic cancer are neuroendocrine tumors, which arise from the hormone-producing cells of the pancreas.</p></a>
<a id="diagnosis">
<h2>DIAGNOSIS</h2>
<p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer may go undetected until it's advanced. By the time symptoms occur, diagnosing pancreatic cancer is usually relatively straightforward. Unfortunately, a cure is rarely possible at that point.</p>
<p>Diagnosing pancreatic cancer usually happens when someone comes to the doctor after experiencing weeks or months of symptoms. Pancreatic cancer symptoms frequently include abdominal pain, weight loss, itching, or jaundice (yellow skin).</p>
<p>A doctor then embarks on a search for the cause, using the tools of the trade:</p>
<ul>
	<li>By taking a medical history, a doctor learns the story of the illness, such as the time of onset, nature and location of pain, smoking history, and other medical problems.</li>
	<li>During a physical exam, a doctor might feel a mass in the abdomen and notice swollen lymph nodes in the neck, jaundiced skin, or weight loss.</li>
	<li>Lab tests may show evidence that bile flow is being blocked, or other abnormalities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on a person's exam, lab tests, and description of symptoms, a doctor often orders an imaging test</p>
<ol type="i">
	<li>Computed tomography (CT scan)</li>
	<li>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</li>
	<li>Ultrasound</li>
	<li>Positron emission tomography (PET scan)</li>
</ol>
<p>If imaging studies detect a mass in the pancreas, a pancreatic cancer diagnosis is likely, but not definite. Only a biopsy--taking actual tissue from the mass -- can diagnose pancreatic cancer.Biopsies can be performed in several ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)</li>
	<li>Endoscopic ultrasound</li>
	<li>Laparoscopy</li>
</ul>
<p>If pancreatic cancer seems very likely, and the tumor appears removable by surgery, doctors may recommend surgery without a biopsy.</p>
</p>
</a>
<a id="types">
<h2>TYPES</h2>
<p>
<p>Although there are several different types of exocrine pancreatic cancer, 95% of cases are due to pancreatic adenocarcinoma.</p>
<p>Other less common exocrine pancreatic cancers include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Adenosquamous carcinoma</li>
	<li>Squamous cell carcinoma</li>
	<li>Giant cell carcinoma</li>
	<li>Acinar cell carcinoma</li>
	<li>Small cell carcinoma</li>
</ul>
<p>The exocrine pancreas makes up 95% of the pancreas, so it's not surprising that most pancreatic cancers arise here.</p>
</p>
</a>
<a id="causes">
<h2>CAUSES</h2>
<p>
<p>Pancreatic cancer develops when a cell in the pancreas acquires damage to its DNA that causes it to behave and multiply abnormally. A single cancer cell grows and divides rapidly, becoming a tumor that does not respect normal boundaries in the body. Eventually, cells from the tumor travel elsewhere in the body (metastasize) through the blood or lymphatic system.</p>

<p>No one knows exactly how the process of DNA damage leading to pancreatic cancer occurs. Analyzing pancreatic cancers removed by surgery shows certain mutations that occur in nearly all cases, and others that vary between people.</p>

<p>Some of these mutations occur randomly. Others occur in response to things we do or experience in the environment. Some mutations may be inherited. When enough mutations accumulate, a cell becomes malignant and a tumor begins to grow.</p>
<p>Pancreatic Cancer Risk Factors</p>
<ul>
<li>GeneticsFive percent to 10% of people with pancreatic cancer have an immediate family member who also had it. Several different genes have been associated with the increased risk, although no "pancreatic cancer gene" has yet been identified.</li>
<li>Diabetes. People with diabetes are not necessarily more likely to get pancreatic cancer but the two have been linked.</li>
<li>Smoking. Cigarette smoking is well known to increase the risk for pancreatic cancer. The more a person smokes, the higher the risk. Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk returns to about that of someone who never smoked.</li>
<li>Obesity and inactivity. In a study of 88,000 nurses, those who were obese (body mass index higher than 30) were more likely to develop pancreatic cancer. Those who exercised frequently were about half as likely to get pancreatic cancer, compared to those who did not exercise at all.</li>
<li>Pancreatic cysts and chronic pancreatitis. People who have one or both of these are at higher risk of developing pancreatic cancer.</li>
<li>Diet. A diet high in fat and meat (especially smoked or processed meat) has been linked to pancreatic cancer in animal studies. Eating a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables decreased pancreatic cancer risk in other studies. Still other studies suggest there's no identifiable link between diet and pancreatic cancer.</li>
<li>Lycopene and selenium. Studies have shown low levels of these nutrients in some people who developed pancreatic cancer. That's not proof that low levels of lycopene and selenium cause pancreatic cancer, though. Any diet that includes lean meat and red or yellow vegetables should provide adequate lycopene and selenium.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<a id="symptoms">
<h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
<p>
<p>Bearing in mind that the disease is rarely diagnosed before the age of 40, common symptoms of pancreatic adenocarcinoma occurring before diagnosis include:</p>
<ul>	
<li>Pain in the upper abdomen or back, often spreading from around the stomach to the back. The location of the pain can indicate the part of the pancreas where a tumor is located. The pain may be worse at night and may increase over time to become severe and unremitting. It may be slightly relieved by bending forward. In the UK, about half of new cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed following a visit to a hospital emergency department for pain or jaundice. In up to two-thirds of people abdominal pain is the main symptom, for 46% of the total accompanied by jaundice, with 13% having jaundice without pain.</li>
<li>Jaundice, a yellow tint to the whites of the eyes or skin, with or without pain, and possibly in combination with darkened urine. This results when a cancer in the head of the pancreas obstructs the common bile duct as it runs through the pancreas.</li>
<li>Unexplained weight loss, either from loss of appetite, or loss of exocrine function resulting in poor digestion.</li>
<li>the tumor may compress neighboring organs, disrupting digestive processes and making it difficult for the stomach to empty, which may cause nausea and a feeling of fullness. The undigested fat leads to foul-smelling, fatty feces that are difficult to flush away.Constipation is common.</li>
<li>At least 50% of people with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have diabetes at the time of diagnosis.While long-standing diabetes is a known risk factor for pancreatic cancer (see Risk factors), the cancer can itself cause diabetes, in which case recent onset of diabetes could be considered an early sign of the disease.People over 50 who develop diabetes have eight times the usual risk of developing pancreatic adenocarcinoma within three years, after which the relative risk declines.</li>

<h2>TREATMENT</h2>
<p>
People whose pancreatic cancer is considered resectable may undergo one of three surgeries:<br>

•	Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy): A surgeon removes the head of the pancreas and sometimes the body of the pancreas, parts of the stomach and small intestine, some lymph nodes, the gallbladder, and the common bile duct. The remaining organs are reconnected in a new way to allow digestion. The Whipple procedure is a difficult and complicated surgery. Surgeons and hospitals that do the most operations have the best results.About half the time, once a surgeon sees inside the abdomen, pancreatic cancer that was thought to be resectable turns out to have spread, and thus be unresectable. The Whipple procedure is not completed in these cases.<br>

•	Distal pancreatectomy: The tail and/or portion of the body of the pancreas are removed, but not the head. This surgery is uncommon for pancreatic cancer, because most tumors arising outside the head of the pancreas within the body or tail are unresectable.<br>

•	Total pancreatectomy: The entire pancreas and the spleen is surgically removed. Although once considered useful, this operation is uncommon today.<br>

Chemotherapy or radiation therapy or both can also be used in conjunction with surgery for resectable and unresectable pancreatic cancer in order to:<br>
	Prevent or delay pancreatic cancer from returning after surgery (adjuvant therapy)<br>
	Chemotherapy includes cancer drugs that travel through the whole body. Chemotherapy ("chemo") kills pancreatic cancer cells in the main tumor as well as those that have spread widely. These chemotherapy drugs can be used for pancreatic cancer:<br>

•	5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine<br>
•	Gemcitabine<br>

Both 5-FU and gemcitabine are given into the veins during regular visits to an oncologist (cancer doctor). An oral drug, capecitabine, may be substituted for 5-FU, especially with radiation.<br>

In radiation therapy, a machine beams high-energy X-rays to the pancreas to kill pancreatic cancer cells. Radiation therapy is done during a series of daily treatments, usually over a period of weeks.<br>

Both radiation therapy and chemotherapy damage some normal cells, along with cancer cells. Side effects can include nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, weight loss, and fatigue as well as toxicity to the blood cells. Symptoms usually cease within a few weeks after radiation therapy is complete.<br>

<a id="stages">
<h2>STAGES</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Stage 0: No spread. Pancreatic cancer is limited to a single layer of cells in the pancreas. The pancreatic cancer is not visible on imaging tests or even to the naked eye.</li>
<li>Stage I: Local growth. Pancreatic cancer is limited to the pancreas, but has grown to less than 2 centimeters across (stage IA) or greater than 2 centimeters (stage IB).</li>
<li>Stage II: Local spread. Pancreatic cancer has grown outside the pancreas, or has spread to nearby lymph nodes.</li>
<li>Stage III: Wider spread. The tumor has expanded into nearby major blood vessels or nerves but has not metastasized.</li>
<li>Stage IV: Confirmed spread. Pancreatic cancer has spread to distant organs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>EXPERT TIPS OF PREVENTION</h2>
<p>
<p>Apart from not smoking, the American Cancer Society recommends keeping a healthy weight, and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing consumption of red and processed meat, although there is no consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically.A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.</p>
<p>In the general population, screening of large groups is not currently considered effective, although newer techniques, and the screening of tightly targeted groups, are being evaluated.Nevertheless, regular screening with endoscopic ultrasound and MRI/CT imaging is recommended for those at high risk from inherited genetics.</p>
