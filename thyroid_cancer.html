<a id="overview">
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>
<p>Thyroid cancer is cancer that develops from the tissues of the thyroid gland.It is a disease in which cells grow abnormally and have the potential to spread to other parts of the body.Symptoms can include swelling or a lump in the neck. Cancer can also occur in the thyroid after spread from other locations, in which case it is not classified as thyroid cancer.</p>
</p>
</a>
<a id="diagnosis">
<h2>DIAGNOSIS</h2>
<p>
<p>After a thyroid nodule is found during a physical examination, a referral to an endocrinologist or a thyroidologist may occur. Most commonly an ultrasound is performed to confirm the presence of a nodule and assess the status of the whole gland. Measurement of thyroid stimulating hormone and anti-thyroid antibodies will help decide if there is a functional thyroid disease such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis present, a known cause of a benign nodular goiter. Measurement of calcitonin is necessary to exclude the presence of medullary thyroid cancer. Finally, to achieve a definitive diagnosis before deciding on treatment, a fine needle aspiration cytology test is usually performed and reported according to the Bethesda system.</p>
</p>
</a>
<a id="types">
<h2>TYPES</h2>
<p>
<p>Thyroid cancers can be classified according to their histopathological characteristics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Papillary thyroid cancer (75% to 85% of cases) – often in young females – excellent prognosis. May occur in women with familial adenomatous polyposis and in patients with Cowden syndrome.</li>
<li>Newly reclassified variant: noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features is considered an indolent tumor of limited biologic potential.</li>
<li>Follicular thyroid cancer (10% to 20% of cases) – occasionally seen in patients with Cowden syndrome</li>
<li>Medullary thyroid cancer (5% to 8% of cases) – cancer of the parafollicular cells, often part of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.</li>
<li>Poorly differentiated thyroid cancer</li>
<li>Anaplastic thyroid cancer (less than 5% of cases) is not responsive to treatment and can cause pressure symptoms.</li>
<li>Thyroid lymphoma</li>
<li>Squamous cell thyroid carcinoma</li>
<li>Sarcoma of thyroid</li>
</ul>
</p>
</a>
<a id="causes">
<h2>CAUSES</h2>
<p>
<p>Thyroid cancers are thought to be related to a number of environmental and genetic predisposing factors, but significant uncertainty remains regarding their causes.</p>
<p>Environmental exposure to ionizing radiation from both natural background sources and artificial sources is suspected to play a significant role, and there are significant increased rates of thyroid cancer in those exposed to mantlefield radiation for lymphoma, and those exposed to iodine-131 following the Chernobyl,[12] Fukushima, Kyshtym, and Windscale[13] nuclear disasters.[14] Thyroiditis and other thyroid diseases also predispose to thyroid cancer.</p>
<p>Genetic causes include multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 which markedly increases rates, particularly of the rarer medullary form of the disease.</p>
</p>
</a>
<a id="symptoms">
<h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
<p>
<p>The symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A lump or swelling in your neck. This is the most common symptom.</li>
	<li>Pain in your neck and sometimes in your ears.</li>
	<li>Difficulty swallowing.</li>
	<li>Difficulty breathing or constant wheezing.</li>
	<li>Hoarseness that is not related to a cold.</li>
	<li>A cough that continues and is not related to a cold.</li>
	<li>Some people may not have any symptoms. Their doctors may find a lump or nodule in the neck during a routine physical exam.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</a>
<a id="treatment">
<h2>TREATMENT</h2>
<p>
<p>The treatments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thyroidectomy and dissection of central neck compartment is initial step in treatment of thyroid cancer in majority of cases.Thyroid-preserving operation may be applied in cases, when thyroid cancer exhibits low biological aggressiveness (e.g. well-differentiated cancer, no evidence of lymph node metastases, low MIB-1 index, no major genetic alterations like BRAF mutations, RET/PTC rearrangements, p53 mutations etc.) in patients younger than 45 years. If the diagnosis of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (e.g. papillary thyroid cancer) is established or suspected by FNA the surgery is indicated, whereas watchful waiting strategy is not recommended in any evidence-based guidelines</li>
<li>Radioactive Iodine-131 is used in patients with papillary or follicular thyroid cancer for ablation of residual thyroid tissue after surgery and for the treatment of thyroid cancer.Patients with medullary, anaplastic, and most Hurthle cell cancers do not benefit from this therapy.</li>
<li>External irradiation may be used when the cancer is unresectable, when it recurs after resection, or to relieve pain from bone metastasis.</li>
<li>Sorafenib and sunitinib, approved for other indications show promise for thyroid cancer and are being used for some patients who do not qualify for clinical trials.Numerous agents are in phase II clinical trials and XL184 has started a phase III trial.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</a>
<a id="stages">
<h2>STAGES</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Stage I: In stage I papillary and follicular thyroid cancer, cancer is found only in the thyroid and the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.</li>
<li>Stage II: In stage II papillary and follicular thyroid cancer, cancer is only in the thyroid and the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters.</li>
<li>Stage III: In stage III papillary and follicular thyroid cancer, either of the following is found:
<ul>
<li>the tumor is larger than 4 centimeters and only in the thyroid or the tumor is any size and cancer has spread to tissues just outside the thyroid, but not to lymph nodes; or</li>
<li>the tumor is any size and cancer may have spread to tissues just outside the thyroid and has spread to lymph nodes near the trachea or the larynx (voice box).</li>
</ul>
<li>Stage IV: Stage IV papillary and follicular thyroid cancer is divided into stages IVA, IVB, and IVC.
<ul>
	<li>In stage IVA, either of the following is found:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>the tumor is any size and cancer has spread outside the thyroid to tissues under the skin, the trachea, the esophagus, the larynx (voice box), and/or the recurrent laryngeal nerve (a nerve that goes to the larynx); cancer may have spread to lymph nodes near the trachea or the larynx; or</li>
    <li>the tumor is any size and cancer may have spread to tissues just outside the thyroid. Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on one or both sides of the neck or between the lungs.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>In stage IVB, cancer has spread to tissue in front of the spinal column or has surrounded the carotid artery or the blood vessels in the area between the lungs. Cancer may have spread to lymph nodes.</li>
	<li>In stage IVC, the tumor is any size and cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs and bones, and may have spread to lymph nodes.
</ul>
</ul>

<h2>EXPERT TIPS OF PREVENTION</h2>
<p>
<p>People with a Normal Risk for Thyroid Cancer</p>
<p>If you don't have any of the common risk factors associated with the disease, there is really only one way to potentially prevent papillary thyroid cancer—reducing radiation exposure during childhood.Radiation therapy (through x-ray tests, for example), may be necessary for your child if he or she has a serious illness. But if these tests aren't totally necessary for your child, it may be best not to have them performed. Generally, though, routine x-rays do not cause the significant radiation exposure that will increase the risk of thyroid cancer (in the absence of external radiation therapy).</p>
<p>People with a High Risk for Thyroid Cancer</p>
<p>If you are a high-risk patient, there are a couple ways that you may reduce—or even eliminate—your odds of developing thyroid cancer.The conditions that increase risk of thyroid cancer include a history of childhood head and neck radiation, total body irradiation for bone marrow transplantation, family history of thyroid carcinoma or thyroid cancer syndrome (e.g. Cowden syndrome, familial polyposis, or Carney comlex).</p>
