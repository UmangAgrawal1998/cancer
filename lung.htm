<h2><b><a id="overview"><u>OVERVIEW</u></a></b></h1>
<p>
</p>
<h2><u><a id="causes"><b>CAUSES</b></a></u></h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
Most cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking, although people who have never smoked can also develop the condition.
1)	Smoking
Smoking cigarettes is the single biggest risk factor for lung cancer. It's responsible for more than 85% of all cases.
Tobacco smoke contains more than 60 different toxic substances, which can lead to the development of cancer. These substances are known to be carcinogenic (cancer-producing).
If you smoke more than 25 cigarettes a day, you are 25 times more likely to get lung cancer than a non-smoker.
While smoking cigarettes is the biggest risk factor, using other types of tobacco products can also increase your risk of developing lung cancer and other types of cancer, such as oesophageal cancer and mouth cancer. These products include:
a)	cigars
b)	pipe tobacco
c)	snuff (a powdered form of tobacco)
d)	chewing tobacco
Smoking cannabis has also been linked to an increased risk of lung cancer. Most cannabis smokers mix their cannabis with tobacco. While they tend to smoke less than tobacco smokers, they usually inhale more deeply and hold the smoke in their lungs for longer.
It's been estimated that smoking four joints (homemade cigarettes mixed with cannabis) may be as damaging to the lungs as smoking 20 cigarettes.
Even smoking cannabis without mixing it with tobacco is potentially dangerous. This is because cannabis also contains substances that can cause cancer.
2)	Passive smoking
If you don't smoke, frequent exposure to other people’s tobacco smoke (passive smoking) can increase your risk of developing lung cancer.
For example, research has found that non-smoking women who share their house with a smoking partner are 25% more likely to develop lung cancer than non-smoking women who live with a non-smoking partner.
3)	Radon
Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas that comes from tiny amounts of uranium present in all rocks and soils. It can sometimes be found in buildings.
If radon is breathed in, it can damage your lungs, particularly if you're a smoker. Radon is estimated to be responsible for about 3% of all lung cancer deaths in England.
4)	Occupational exposure and pollution
Exposure to certain chemicals and substances used in several occupations and industries has been linked to a slightly higher risk of developing lung cancer. These chemicals and substances include:
a)	Arsenic
b)	Asbestos
c)	Beryllium
d)	Cadmium
e)	coal and coke fumes
f)	silica
g)	nickel
Research also suggests that being exposed to large amounts of diesel fumes for many years may increase your risk of developing lung cancer by up to 50%. One study has shown that your risk of developing lung cancer increases by about a third if you live in an area with high levels of nitrogen oxide gases (mostly produced by cars and other vehicles).

<h2><a id="symptoms"><b><u>SYMPTOMS</u></b></a></h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
Symptoms of non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer are basically the same.

Early symptoms may include:

1)	lingering or worsening cough 
2)	coughing up phlegm or blood
3)	chest pain that worsens when you breathe deeply, laugh, or cough
4)	hoarseness
5)	shortness of breath
6)	wheezing
7)	weakness and fatigue
8)	loss of appetite and weight loss
9)	You might also have recurrent respiratory infections such as pneumonia or bronchitis.


As cancer spreads, additional symptoms depend on where new tumors form. For example, if in the:
1)	lymph nodes: lumps, particularly in the neck or collarbone
2)	bones: bone pain, particularly in the back, ribs, or hips
3)	brain or spine: headache, dizziness, balance issues, or numbness in arms or legs
4)	liver: yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice)
5)	Tumors at the top of the lungs can affect facial nerves, leading to drooping of one eyelid, small pupil, or lack of perspiration on one side of the face. Together, these symptoms are called Horner syndrome. It can also cause shoulder pain.
6)	Tumors can press on the large vein that transports blood between the head, arms, and heart. This can cause swelling of the face, neck, upper chest, and arms.
7)	Lung cancer sometimes creates a substance similar to hormones, causing a wide variety of symptoms called paraneoplastic syndrome, which include:
a)	muscle weakness
b)	nausea
c)	vomiting
d)	fluid retention
e)	high blood pressure
f)	high blood sugar
g)	confusion
h)	seizures
i)	coma
j)	back pain
Back pain is fairly common in the general population. It’s possible to have lung cancer and unrelated back pain. Most people with back pain don’t have lung cancer.
Not everyone with lung cancer gets back pain, but many do. For some people, back pain turns out to be one of the first symptoms of lung cancer.
Back pain can be due to the pressure of large tumors growing in the lungs. It can also mean that cancer has spread to your spine or ribs. As it grows, a cancerous tumor can cause compression of the spinal cord.
That can lead to neurologic deterioration causing:
a)	weakness of the arms and legs
b)	numbness or loss of sensation in the legs and feet
c)	urinary and bowel incontinence
d)	interference with the spinal blood supply
e)	Without treatment, back pain caused by cancer will continue to worsen. Back pain may improve if treatment such as surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy can successfully remove or shrink the tumor.
f)	In addition, your doctor can use corticosteroids or prescribe pain relievers such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). For more severe pain, opioids such as morphine or oxycodone may be needed.

<h2><a id="stages"><b><u>STAGES</u></b></a></h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
Cancer stages tell how far the cancer has spread and help guide treatment. The chance of successful or curative treatment is much higher when lung cancer is diagnosed and treated in the early stages, before it spreads. Because lung cancer doesn’t cause obvious symptoms in the earlier stages, diagnosis often comes after it has spread.
Non-small cell lung cancer has four main stages:
Stage 1: Cancer is found in the lung, but it has not spread outside the lung.
Stage 2: Cancer is found in the lung and nearby lymph nodes.
Stage 3: Cancer is in the lung and lymph nodes in the middle of the chest.
Stage 3A: Cancer is found in lymph nodes, but only on the same side of the chest where cancer first started growing.
Stage 3B: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the opposite side of the chest or to lymph nodes above the collarbone.
Stage 4: Cancer has spread to both lungs, into the area around the lungs, or to distant
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) has two main stages. In the limited stage, cancer is found in only one lung or nearby lymph nodes on the same side of the chest.
The extensive stage means cancer has spread:

1)	throughout one lung
2)	to the opposite lung
3)	to lymph nodes on the opposite side
4)	to fluid around the lung
5)	to bone marrow
6)	to distant organs

<h2><a id="diagnosis"><b><u>DIAGNOSIS</u></b></a></h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
After a physical examination, your doctor will tell you how to prepare for specific tests, such as:
1)	Imaging tests: An abnormal mass can be seen on X-ray. MRI, CT, and PET scans. These scans produce more detail and find smaller lesions.
2)	Sputum cytology: If you produce phlegm when you cough, microscopic examination can determine if cancer cells are present.
A biopsy can determine if tumor cells are cancerous. A tissue sample can be obtained by:
1)	Bronchoscopy: While under sedation, a lighted tube is passed down your throat and into your lungs, allowing closer examination.
2)	Mediastinoscopy: The doctor makes an incision at the base of the neck. A lighted instrument is inserted and surgical tools are used to take samples from lymph nodes. It’s usually performed in a hospital under general anesthesia.
3)	Needle: Using imaging tests as a guide, a needle is inserted through the chest wall and into the suspicious lung tissue. Needle biopsy can also be used to test lymph nodes.
Tissue samples are sent to a pathologist for analysis. If the result is positive for cancer, further testing, such as a bone scan, can help determine if cancer has spread and to help with staging.
For this test, you’ll be injected with a radioactive chemical. Abnormal areas of bone will then be highlighted on the images. MRI, CT, and PET scan are also used for staging.

<h2><a id="treatment"><b><u>TREATMENT</u></b></a></h2>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
It’s usually a good idea to seek a second opinion before beginning treatment. Your doctor may be able to help make that happen. If you’re diagnosed with lung cancer, your care will likely be managed by a team of doctors who may include:
a)	a surgeon who specializes in the chest and lungs (thoracic surgeon)
b)	a lung specialist (pulmonologist)
c)	a medical oncologist
d)	a radiation oncologist
Discuss all your treatment options before making a decision. Your doctors will coordinate care and keep each other informed. Treatment for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) varies from person to person. Much depends on specific details of your health.
Stage 1 NSCLC: Surgery to remove a portion of the lung may be all you need. Chemotherapy may also be recommended, especially if you’re at high risk of recurrence.
Stage 2 NSCLC: You may need surgery to remove part or all of your lung. Chemotherapy is usually recommended.
Stage 3 NSCLC: You may require a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation treatment.
Stage 4 NSCLC is particularly hard to cure. Options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.
Options for small cell-lung cancer (NSCLC) also include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In most cases, the cancer will be too advanced for surgery.
Clinical trials provide access to promising new treatments. Ask your doctor if you’re eligible for clinical trial.
Some people with advanced lung cancer choose not to continue with treatment. You can still choose palliative care treatments, which are focused on treating the symptoms of cancer rather than the cancer itself.

(HOME REMEDIES)
Home remedies and homeopathic remedies won’t cure cancer. But certain home remedies may help relieve some of the symptoms associated with lung cancer and side effects of treatment.
Ask your doctor if you should take dietary supplements and if so, which ones. Some herbs, plant extracts, and other home remedies can interfere with treatment and endanger your health. Be sure to discuss all complementary therapies with your doctor to make sure they’re safe for you.
Options may include:
•	Massage: With a qualified therapist, massage can help relieve pain and anxiety. Some massage therapists are trained to work with people with cancer.
•	Acupuncture: When performed by a trained practitioner, acupuncture may help ease pain, nausea, and vomiting. But it’s not safe if you have low blood counts or take blood thinners.
•	Meditation: Relaxation and reflection can reduce stress and improve overall quality of life in cancer patients.
•	Hypnosis: Helps you relax and may help with nausea, pain, and anxiety.
•	Yoga: Combining breathing techniques, meditation, and stretching, yoga can help you feel better overall and improve sleep.
Some people with cancer turn to cannabis oil. It can be infused into cooking oil to squirt in your mouth or mix with food. Or the vapors can be inhaled. This may relieve nausea and vomiting and improve appetite. Human studies are lacking and laws for use of cannabis oil vary from state to state.

<h1><a id="rate"><b><u>LIFE EXPECTANCY RATE</u></b></a></h1>
<p style="font-size: 25px">
Once cancer enters the lymph nodes and bloodstream, it can spread anywhere in the body. The outlook is better when treatment begins before cancer spreads outside the lungs.
Other factors include age, overall health, and how well you respond to treatment. Because early symptoms can be easily overlooked, lung cancer is usually diagnosed in later stages.
Survival rates and other statistics provide a broad picture of what to expect. There are significant individual differences, though. Your doctor is in the best position to discuss your outlook.
Current survival statistics don’t tell the whole story. In recent years, new treatments have been approved for stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Some people are surviving much longer than previously seen with traditional treatments.
The following are the estimated five-year survival rates for NSCLC by stage:
•	Stage 1: 45 to 49 percent
•	Stage 2: 30 to 31 percent
•	Stage 3A: 14 percent
•	Stage 3B: 5 percent
•	Stage 4: 1 percent
Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is very aggressive. For limited stage SCLC, the five-year survival rate is 14 percent. Median survival is 16 to 24 months. Median survival for extensive stage SCLC is six to 12 months. Long-term disease-free survival is rare. Without treatment, median survival from diagnosis of SCLC is only two to four months.
The relative five-year survival rate for mesothelioma, a type of cancer caused by asbestos exposure, is 5 to 10 percent.
