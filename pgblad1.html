<a id="overview">
<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<b>
<p><big>The bladder is a hollow organ in the lower abdomen (pelvis). It collects and stores urine produced by the kidneys.<br>
The bladder is connected to the kidneys by a tube from each kidney called a ureter.<br>
When the bladder reaches its capacity of urine, the bladder wall contracts, although adults have voluntary control over the timing of this contraction. At the same time, a urinary control muscle (sphincter) in the urethra relaxes. The urine is then expelled from the bladder.<br>
The urine flows through a narrow tube called the urethra and leaves the body. This process is called urination, or micturition.<br>
Cancer occurs when normal cells undergo a degenerative, dangerous, or what is called a malignant change or transformation causing them to grow abnormally and multiply without normal controls. A mass of cancerous cells is called a malignant tumor or cancer. The cancerous cells are capable of spreading to other areas of the body through the process of metastasis. A cancer can become destructive locally to the tissues adjacent to where it arises. Cancer cells can also metastasize. Metastasis means that cells spread through the tissue fluid's circulation called the lymphatic system or through the bloodstream where they can then stop off in other tissues or organs where they may grow as metastases or metastatic deposits and can become destructive in these new locations. The term cancer is further described by the tissue in which it has arisen. For example: bladder cancer is a different disease than lung cancer. If a bladder cancer cell metastasizes -- that is, spreads to the lungs through the bloodstream it is still called, and is treated as metastatic bladder cancer, not as lung cancer.Cells which transform in a less dangerous fashion may still multiply and form masses or tumors. These are called benign tumors. They do not metastasize.<br>
Of the different types of cells that form the bladder, the cells lining the inside of the bladder wall are those most likely to develop cancer. Any of three different cell types can become cancerous. The resulting cancers are named after the cell types.<br>
Urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell carcinoma): This is by far the most common type of bladder cancer in the United States. The so-called transitional cells are normal cells that form the innermost lining of the bladder wall, the urothelium. In transitional cell carcinoma, these normal lining cells undergo changes that lead to the uncontrolled cell growth characteristic of cancer.<br>
Squamous cell carcinoma: These cancers are comprised of cells that typically form as a result of bladder inflammation or irritation that has taken place for many months or years. These cells grow in flat masses of interconnected cells.<br>
Adenocarcinoma: These cancers form from cells that make up glands. Glands are specialized structures that produce and release fluids such as mucus.<br>
In the United States, urothelial carcinomas account for more than 90% of all bladder cancers. Squamous cell carcinomas make up 3%-8%, and adenocarcinomas make up 1%-2%.Only transitional cells normally line the rest of the urinary tract. The kidney's internal collecting system, the ureters (narrow tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder), the bladder, and the urethra are lined with these cells. Thus, individuals with transitional cell cancers of the bladder are at risk for transitional cell cancers of the kidneys/ureter (upper urinary tract)<br></p></a>

<h2>DIAGNOSIS</h2>
<p>Early diagnosis
At first diagnosis done. Although medical treatments are fairly standardized, different doctors have different philosophies and practices in caring for their patients. If bladder cancer is suspected or is a possible concern of your primary care doctor or internists then they may refer you to a urologist. Urologists are surgeons who specialize in the management of disorders of the urinary system. When selecting your urologist, you will want to identify someone who is skilled in treating bladder cancer and with whom you feel comfortable.<br>
You may want to talk to more than one urologist to find the one with whom you feel most comfortable. Clinical experience in treating bladder cancer is of the utmost importance.<br>
A urologist may also recommend or involve other specialists in your care either for their opinions or assistance in treating you. These specialists may be a radiation oncologist and/or a medical oncologist.<br>
Talk to family members, friends, and your health care provider to get referrals. Many communities, medical societies, and cancer centers offer telephone or Internet referral services.<br>
After you have chosen a urologist to treat your cancer, you will have ample opportunity to ask questions and discuss the treatments available to you.<br>
Your doctor will describe each type of treatment, give you the pros and cons, and make recommendations based on published treatment guidelines and his or her own experience.<br>
Treatment for bladder cancer depends on the type of cancer and its stage. Factors such as your age, your overall health, and whether you have already been treated for the cancer before are included in the treatment decision-making process.<br>
The decision of which treatment to pursue is made after discussions with your doctor (with input from other members of your care team) and your family members, but the decision is ultimately yours.<br>
Be certain you understand exactly what will be done and why, and what you can expect from your choices. With bladder cancer, understanding the side effects of treatment is especially important. Other physicians that you may meet include a medical oncologist, a medical doctor specializing in the treatment of cancer, and a radiation oncologist, a specialized cancer doctor who treats cancer with radiation-based treatments.<br>
Like all cancers, bladder cancer is most likely to be cured if it is diagnosed early and treated promptly.<br>
The type of therapy you receive will vary with the stage and grade of the bladder cancer and your overall health.<br>
For lower-grade and stage tumors, less invasive options such as treatments placed directly into the bladder, referred to as intravesical therapy, may be an option.<br>
For more invasive cancers, surgical therapies, radiation, and chemotherapy are options, depending on the extent of the cancer and your overall health<br>
Your treatment team will also include one or more nurses, a dietitian, a social worker, and other professionals as needed.<br>
Standard therapies for bladder cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy or biological therapy.<br>
Surgery and radiation therapy are comparatively local therapies. This means that they get rid of cancer cells only in the treated area. The bladder itself may be treated or the surgery and/or radiation may be extended to adjacent structure in the pelvic region.<br>
Chemotherapy is systemic therapy. This means that it can kill cancer cells almost anywhere in the body.<br>
Immunotherapy is also local therapy and involves a treatment placed into the bladder.<br>
Radiation Therapy<br>
Radiation is a painless, invisible high-energy ray that can kill both cancer cells and normal cells in its path. New radiation treatments are able to focus radiation better and damage fewer normal cells. Radiation may be given for small muscle-invasive bladder cancers. It is commonly used as an alternative approach to or in addition to surgery, often in patients who may be too ill to undergo surgery. Either of two types of radiation can be used. However, for greatest therapeutic efficacy, it should be given in conjunction with chemotherapy:<br>
External radiation is produced by a machine outside the body. The machine targets a concentrated beam of radiation directly at the tumor. This form of therapy is usually spread out in short treatments given five days a week for 5 to 7 weeks. Spreading it out this way helps protect the surrounding healthy tissues by lowering the dose of each treatment. In addition, as cells are more sensitive to radiation during different phases in cell growth, and cancer cells are typically faster growing than normal cells, the use of frequent dosing is designed to kill cancer cells more readily and decrease the risk of killing normal cells. External radiation is given at the hospital or medical center. You come to the center each day as an outpatient to receive your radiation therapy.<br>
Internal radiation is given by many different techniques. One involves placing a small pellet of radioactive material inside the bladder. The pellet can be inserted through the urethra or by making a tiny incision in the lower abdominal wall. You have to stay in the hospital during the entire treatment, which lasts several days. Visits by family and friends are restricted to protect them from the effects of radiation. When the treatment is done, the pellet is removed and you are allowed to go home. This form of radiation is rarely used for bladder cancer in the United States.<br>
Unfortunately, radiation affects not only cancer cells but also any healthy tissues it touches. With external radiation, healthy tissue overlying or adjacent to the tumor can be damaged if the radiation cannot be focused enough. The side effects of radiation depend on the dose and the area of the body where the radiation is targeted.<br>

The area of your skin where the radiation passes through may become reddened, sore, dry, or itchy. The effect is not unlike sunburn. Although these effects can be severe, they are usually not permanent. The skin in this area may become permanently darker, however. Internal organs, bones, and other tissues can also be damaged. Internal radiation was developed to avoid these complications.
You may feel very tired during radiation therapy.<br>
Radiation to the pelvis, as is needed for bladder cancer, can affect production of blood cells in the bone marrow. Common effects include extreme tiredness, increased susceptibility to infections, and easy bruising or bleeding.<br>
Radiation to the pelvis may also cause nausea, rectal irritation leading to changes in bowel movements, and blood in the stool as well as urinary problems, and sexual problems such as vaginal dryness in women and impotence in men. Such problems arise shortly after treatment begins, or may appear sometime after radiation treatments are completed.<br>

<a id="symptoms">
<h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
<p>
The most common symptoms of bladder cancer include the following:<br>
Blood in the urine (hematuria)<br>
Pain or burning during urination without evidence of urinary tract infection<br>
Change in bladder habits, such as having to urinate more often or feeling the strong urge to urinate without producing much urine, having troubles urinating, or having a weak urine stream<br>
These symptoms are nonspecific. This means that these symptoms are also linked with many other conditions that have nothing to do with cancer. Having these symptoms does not necessarily mean you have bladder cancer.<br>

If you have any of these symptoms, you should see your health-care professional right away. People who can see blood in their urine (gross hematuria), especially older males who smoke, are considered to have a high likelihood of bladder cancer until proven otherwise.<br>
Blood in the urine is usually the first warning sign of bladder cancer; however, it is also associated with a number of benign medical problems such as urinary tract infection, kidney/bladder stones, and benign tumors and does not mean a person has bladder cancer. Unfortunately, the blood is often invisible to the eye. This is called microscopic hematuria, and it is detectable with a simple urine test. In some cases, enough blood is in the urine to noticeably change the urine color, gross hematuria. The urine may have a slightly pink or orange hue, or it may be bright red with or without clots. If your urine changes color beyond just being more or less concentrated, particularly if you see blood in the urine, you need to see your health-care professional promptly. Visible blood in the urine is referred to as gross, or macroscopic, hematuria.<br>
Bladder cancer often causes no symptoms until it reaches an advanced stage that is difficult to cure. Therefore, you may want to talk to your health-care professional about screening tests if you have risk factors for bladder cancer. Screening is testing for cancer in people who have never had the disease and have no symptoms but who have one or more risk factors.<br>

<a id="causes">
<h2>CAUSES</h2>
<p>
<p>Bladder cancer may develop related to changes in DNA (the material in cells that makes up genes and controls how cells work). These changes may turn on certain genes, oncogenes, that will tell the cells to grow, divide, and stay alive, or turn off suppressor genes, genes that control the division of cells, repair of mistakes in the DNA, and death of cells. Changes in genes may be inherited (passed on from parents) or acquired as a result of certain risk factors.<br>
A number of chemicals (carcinogens) have been identified that are potential causes, especially in cigarette smoke. We do know that the following factors increase a person's risk of developing a bladder cancer:<br>
Tobacco Smoking: Smoking is the single greatest risk factor for bladder cancer. Smokers are at least three times more likely to develop bladder cancer as nonsmokers. Smoking cessation is key to lessening the risk of relapse especially in superficial bladder cancer.<br>
Chemical exposures at work: People who regularly work with certain chemicals or in certain industries have a greater risk of bladder cancer than the general population. Organic chemicals called aromatic amines are particularly linked with bladder cancer. These chemicals are used in the dye industry. Other industries linked to bladder cancer include rubber and leather processing, textiles, hair coloring, paints, and printing. Strict workplace protections can prevent much of the exposure that is believed to cause cancer.<br>
Diet: People whose diets include large amounts of fried meats and animal fats are thought to be at higher risk of bladder cancer. Not drinking enough fluids, especially water, each day may increase the risk of bladder cancer. The data regarding the effects of coffee on the risk of developing bladder cancer are variable; however, currently coffee consumption is actually thought to decrease the risk of several cancers.<br>
Medications: According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), use of the diabetes medication pioglitazone (Actos) for more than one year may increase the risk of developing bladder cancer. Prior chemotherapy with the medication cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) also can increase the risk of bladder cancer.<br>
Pelvic radiation for cancers of the pelvic organs (prostate, uterus, cervix, and colon/rectum) may increase the risk of bladder cancer.<br>
Arsenic in the drinking water, although not typically a problem in the United States, may also increase the risk of bladder cancer.<br>
Aristolochia fangchi: This herb is used in some dietary supplements and Chinese herbal remedies. People who took this herb as part of a weight loss program had higher rates of bladder cancer and kidney failure than the general population. Scientific studies on this herb have shown that it contains chemicals that can cause cancer in rats.<br>
These are factors you can do something about. You can stop smoking, learn to avoid workplace chemical exposures, or change your diet. You cannot do anything about the following risk factors for bladder cancer:<br>

Age: Seniors are at the highest risk of developing bladder cancer.<br>
Sex: Men are three times more likely than women to have bladder cancer.<br>
Race: Whites have a much higher risk of developing bladder cancer than other races.<br>
History of bladder cancer: If you have had bladder cancer in the past, your risk of developing another bladder cancer is higher than if you had never had bladder cancer.<br>
Chronic bladder inflammation: Frequent bladder infections, bladder stones, chronic indwelling urinary catheters (Foley catheters), and other urinary tract problems that irritate the bladder increase the risk of developing a cancer, more commonly squamous cell carcinoma.<br>
Infection with a parasite (a worm), schistosomiasis, can increase the risk of bladder cancer. Schistosomiasis is common in Egypt and also noted in Africa and the Middle East.<br>
Birth defects: The urachus is a connection between the belly button (umbilicus) and the bladder in the fetus that typically disappears before birth, but if part of the connection remains after birth, it can become cancerous with a type of cancer called a urachal adenocarcinoma. A rare birth defect, bladder exstrophy, in which the bladder and belly wall are open and the bladder is exposed outside of the body, can increase the risk of bladder cancer.<br>
Genetics and family history: Those individuals with family members with bladder cancer are at increased risk of developing bladder cancer. Several genetic syndromes are associated with an increased risk of developing bladder cancer, including defects in the retinoblastoma (RB1) gene, Cowden disease, and Lynch syndrome.<br>

<a id="treatment">
<span><h2><b>TREATMENT</b></h2></span>
surgery is by far the most widely used treatment for bladder cancer. It is used for all types and stages of bladder cancer. Several different types of surgery are used. Which type is used in any situation depends largely on the stage of the tumor. Many surgical procedures are available today that have not gained widespread acceptance. They can be difficult to perform, and good outcomes are best achieved by those who perform many of these surgeries per year. The types of surgery are as follows:<br>

1)	Transurethral resection with fulguration: In this operation, an instrument (resectoscope) is inserted through the urethra and into the bladder. A small wire loop on the end of the instrument then removes the tumor by cutting it or burning it with electrical current (fulguration). This is usually performed for the initial diagnosis of bladder cancer and for the treatment of stages Ta and T1 cancers. Your surgeon may administer a dose of intravesical mitomycin after the TURBT to prevent cancer cells that are floating in the bladder after the resection from attaching the bladder and causing a recurrence of the bladder cancer. Often, after transurethral resection, additional treatment is given (for example, intravesical therapy) to help treat the bladder cancer, depending on the grade and stage of the bladder cancer.<br>
2)	Radical cystectomy: In this operation, the entire bladder is removed, as well as its surrounding lymph nodes and other structures adjacent to the bladder that may contain cancer. This is usually performed for cancers that have at least invaded into the muscular layer of the bladder wall or for more superficial cancers that extend over much of the bladder or that have failed to respond to more conservative treatments. Occasionally, the bladder is removed to relieve severe urinary symptoms.<br>
If the urethra, the tube that connects the bladder to the perineum, is involved with cancer, the urethra may need to be removed along with the bladder, known as radical cystectomy plus urethrectomy (cystourethrectomy).<br>
3)	Segmental or partial cystectomy: In this operation, part of the bladder is removed. This is usually performed for solitary low-grade tumors that have invaded the bladder wall but are limited to a small area of the bladder and have not spread outside of the bladder.<br>
As the name implies, radical cystectomy is major surgery. Not only the entire bladder but also other structures are removed.<br>
In men, the prostate and seminal vesicles are removed. (The seminal vesicles are small structures that contain fluid that is part of the ejaculate.) This operation stops prevents sperm and semen from coming out when you ejaculate, called dry ejaculate. The nerves that go to the penis to cause erections may also be affected by the surgery, causing erectile dysfunction.
In women, the womb (uterus), ovaries, and part of the vagina are removed. This permanently stops menstruation, and you can no longer become pregnant. The operation may also interfere with sexual and urinary functions.
Removal of the bladder is complicated because it requires creation of a new pathway for urine to be stored and to leave the body. There are a variety of different surgical procedures that can be performed. Some people wear a bag outside the body to collect urine, called noncontinent urinary diversion. Others have a small pouch made inside the body to collect urine, known as continent urinary diversion. The pouch is usually made by a surgeon from a small piece of the intestine. A connection between the pouch and the skin can be catheterized with a small catheter (hollow tube) to empty the pouch. In others, a new bladder can be made of intestine that is sewn to the urethra (neobladder), and one can void either by increasing abdominal pressure or catheterizing per urethra to empty the bladder,
Historically, the ureters, the tubes that drained the kidneys, were attached to the colon, and one would empty both urine and stool together. This procedure was associated with a risk of developing cancer near the area where the ureter was sewn into the colon, so it is rarely used today in the U.S. but may still be used in some underdeveloped countries.
Surgeons and medical oncologists are working together to find ways to avoid radical cystectomy. A combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy may allow some patients to preserve their bladder; however, the toxicity of the therapy is significant, with many patients requiring surgery to remove the bladder at a later date, due to severe voiding symptoms, frequency, urgency, pain and blood in the urine.
If your urologist recommends surgery as treatment for your bladder cancer, be sure you understand the type of surgery you will have and what effects the surgery will have on your life.

Even if the surgeon believes that the entire cancer is removed by the operation, many people who undergo surgery for bladder cancer receive chemotherapy after the surgery. This "adjuvant" (or "in addition") chemotherapy is designed to kill any cancer cells remaining after surgery and to increase the chance of a cure.

Some patients may receive chemotherapy before radical cystectomy. This is called "neoadjuvant" chemotherapy and may be recommended by your surgeon and oncologist. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can kill any microscopic cancer cells that may have spread to other parts of the body and can also shrink the tumor in your bladder before surgery.

If it has been decided that you need chemotherapy in conjunction with your radical cystectomy, the decision to elect neoadjuvant before surgery or adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery will be made together on a case-by-case basis by the patient, medical oncologist, and urologic oncologist.
