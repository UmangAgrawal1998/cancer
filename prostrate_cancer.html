<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>
<p>Prostate cancer is the development of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system.Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly The cancer cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes.It may initially cause no symptoms.In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells.

<a id="diagnosis">
<h2>DIAGNOSIS</h2>
<p>
The only test that can fully confirm the diagnosis of prostate cancer is a biopsy, the removal of small pieces of the prostate for microscopic examination. However, prior to a biopsy, less invasive testing can be conducted.
There are also several other tests that can be used to gather more information about the prostate and the urinary tract. Digital rectal examination (DRE) may allow a doctor to detect prostate abnormalities. Cystoscopy shows the urinary tract from inside the bladder, using a thin, flexible camera tube inserted down the urethra. Transrectal ultrasonography creates a picture of the prostate using sound waves from a probe in the rectum.
•	Biopsy
If cancer is suspected, a biopsy is offered expediently. During a biopsy a urologist or radiologist obtains tissue samples from the prostate via the rectum. A biopsy gun inserts and removes special hollow-core needles (usually three to six on each side of the prostate) in less than a second. Prostate biopsies are routinely done on an outpatient basis and rarely require hospitalization. Antibiotics should be used to prevent complications like fever, urinary tract infections, and sepsis.[70] Fifty-five percent of men report discomfort during prostate biopsy.[71]

•	Gleason score
The tissue samples are then examined under a microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present, and to evaluate the microscopic features (or Gleason score) of any cancer found. Prostate specific membrane antigen is a transmembrane carboxypeptidase and exhibits folate hydrolase activity.[72] This protein is overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues and is associated with a higher Gleason score.

•	Tumor markers
Tissue samples can be stained for the presence of PSA and other tumor markers in order to determine the origin of malignant cells that have metastasized.[73]
Small cell carcinoma is a very rare (1%[74]) type of prostate cancer that cannot be diagnosed using the PSA.[74][75] As of 2009 researchers were researching ways to screen for this type of prostate cancer, because it is quick to spread to other parts of the body.[75]
The oncoprotein BCL-2 is associated with the development of androgen-independent prostate cancer, due to its high levels of expression in androgen-independent tumours in advanced stages of the pathology. The upregulation of BCL-2 after androgen ablation in prostate carcinoma cell lines and in a castrated-male rat model further established a connection between BCL-2 expression and prostate cancer progression.[76]
The expression of Ki-67 by immunohistochemistry may be a significant predictor of patient outcome for men with prostate cancer.[77

<a id="types">
<h2>TYPES</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH): This is a benign (non-cancerous) type of tumor of the prostate.  The prostate grows larger and squeezes the urethra.  This prevents the normal flow of urine.  BPH is a very common problem.  For some men the symptoms may be severe enough to need treatment or surgery.</li>
<li>Prostatic adenocarcinoma: This type of tumor is the most frequent form of prostate cancer and accounts for 90 to 95% of prostate cancer.  Prostatic adenocarcinoma is occurring in the cells lining the glandular organ of the prostate, the area responsible for the secretion of the chemicals that make up a large portion of seminal fluid.  The most common site of origin of prostate cancer is the peripheral zone where two thirds of the prostate glandular tissue is located.  Typically, prostatic adenocarcinoma is a slow growing form of cancer, and when found early there is a good chance of achieving cures.</li>
<li>Small cell carcinoma:  This type of cancer is made of small round cells. It is a very aggressive form of prostate cancer that does not lead to a change in prostate specific antigen (PSA).  It thus can be more difficult to detect than adenocarcinoma.  The small cell carcinoma has usually reached an advanced form upon detection.</li>
<li>Squamous cell carcinoma: This type of prostate cancer is non glandular and like small cell carcinoma does not lead to an increase in prostate specific antigens (PSA).  Squamous cell carcinoma is a very aggressive form of cancer.</li>
<li>Prostatic sarcomas: This type of cancer is extremely rare and account for less than 0.1% of primary prostate cancer.  Prostatic sarcoma occurs in relatively younger men between the ages of 35 and 60.  The tumor is made up of prostate cancer cell types that are capable of developing into connective tissues, lymphatic vessels, and blood vessels originating from smooth muscles of the prostate.</li>
<li>Transitional cell carcinomas: This type of cancer rarely develops in the prostate but derives from primary tumors present in the bladder or urethra.</li>
</ul>

<a id="causes">
<h2>CAUSES</h2>
<p>
<p>It is not known exactly what causes prostate cancer, although a number of things can increase your risk of developing the condition.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Age –risk rises as you get older and most cases are diagnosed in men over 50 years of age.</li>
	<li>Ethnic group –prostate cancer is more common among men of African-Caribbean and African descent than in men of Asian  descent.</li>
	<li>Family history –having a brother or father who developed prostate cancer under the age of 60 seems to increase the risk of you developing it. Research also shows that having a close female relative who developed breast cancer may also increase your risk of developing prostate cancer. </li>
	<li>Obesity – recent research suggests that there may be a link between obesity and prostate cancer.</li>
	<li>Exercise – men who regularly exercise have also been found to be at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.</li>
	<li>Diet – research is ongoing into the links between diet and prostate cancer. There is evidence that a diet high in calcium is linked to an increased risk of developing prostate cancer.</li>
	<li>Sexual factors-Several case-control studies have shown that having many lifetime sexual partners or starting sexual activity early in life substantially increases the risk of prostate cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, some research has shown that prostate cancer rates appear to be lower in men who eat foods containing certain nutrients including lycopene, found in cooked tomatoes and other red fruit, and selenium, found in brazil nuts. However, more research is needed.</p>
</p>
</a>
<a id="symptoms">
<h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
<p>
<p>Because of the proximity of the prostate gland in relation to the bladder and urethra, prostate cancer may be accompanied by a variety of urinary symptoms. Depending on the size and location, a tumor may press on and constrict the urethra, inhibiting the flow of urine. Some prostate cancer signs related to urination include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burning or pain during urination</li>
<li>Difficulty urinating, or trouble starting and stopping while urinating</li>
<li>More frequent urges to urinate at night</li>
<li>Loss of bladder control</li>
<li>Decreased flow or velocity of urine stream</li>
<li>Blood in urine (hematuria)</li>
</ul>
<p>Prostate cancer may spread (metastasize) to nearby tissues or bones. If the cancer spreads to the spine, it may press on the spinal nerves. Other prostate cancer symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blood in semen</li>
<li>Difficulty getting an erection (erectile dysfunction)</li>
<li>Painful ejaculation</li>
<li>Swelling in legs or pelvic area</li>
<li>Numbness or pain in the hips, legs or feet</li>
<li>Bone pain that doesn't go away, or leads to fractures</li>
</ul>
</p>
</a>
<a id="treatment">
<h2>TREATMENT</h2>
<p>
<p>Surgery</p>
<p>Surgery is the removal of the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue during an operation. It is used to try to eliminate a tumor before it spreads outside the prostate. A surgical oncologist is a doctor who specializes in treating cancer using surgery. Surgical options include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Radical (open) prostatectomy. A radical prostatectomy is the surgical removal of the entire prostate and the seminal vesicles. Lymph nodes in the pelvic area may also be removed. This operation has the risk of interfering with sexual function. </li>
	<li>Robotic or laparoscopic prostatectomy. This type of surgery is possibly much less invasive than a radical prostatectomy and may shorten recovery time. A camera and instruments are inserted through small keyhole incisions in the patient’s abdomen. The surgeon then directs the robotic instruments to remove the prostate gland and some surrounding healthy tissue. </li>
</ul>
<p>Radiation therapy</p>
<p>Radiation therapy is the use of high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells. A doctor who specializes in giving radiation therapy to treat cancer is called a radiation oncologist. A radiation therapy regimen (schedule) usually consists of a specific number of treatments given over a set period of time.<p>
<ul>
<li>External-beam radiation therapy. External-beam radiation therapy is the most common type of radiation treatment. The radiation oncologist uses a machine located outside the body to focus a beam of x-rays on the area with the cancer. Some cancer centers use conformal radiation therapy (CRT), in which computers help precisely map the location and shape of the cancer. CRT reduces radiation damage to healthy tissues and organs around the tumor by directing the radiation therapy beam from different directions to focus the dose on the tumor.</li>
<li>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). IMRT is a type of external-beam radiation therapy that uses CT scans to form a 3-dimensional (3D) picture of the prostate before treatment. A computer uses this information about the size, shape, and location of the prostate cancer to determine how much radiation is needed to destroy it. With IMRT, high doses of radiation can be directed at the prostate without increasing the risk of damaging nearby organs.</li>
<li>Proton therapy. Proton therapy, also called proton beam therapy, is a type of external-beam radiation therapy that uses protons rather than x-rays. At high energy, protons can destroy cancer cells. Current research has not shown that proton therapy provides any more benefit to men with prostate cancer than traditional radiation therapy. It is also more expensive.</li>
<li>Brachytherapy. Brachytherapy, or internal radiation therapy, is the insertion of radioactive sources directly into the prostate. These sources, called seeds, give off radiation just around the area where they are inserted and may be left for a short time (high-dose rate) or for a longer time (low-dose rate). Low-dose rate seeds are left in the prostate permanently and work for up to 1 year after they are inserted. However, how long they work depends on the source of radiation used. High-dose rate brachytherapy is usually left in the body for less than 30 minutes, but may need to be given more than once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Focal therapies</p>
<p>Focal therapies are noninvasive treatments that destroy small prostate tumors without treating the rest of the prostate gland. These treatments use heat, cold, and other methods to treat cancer, primarily for men with low-risk or intermediate-risk prostate cancer. An example of focal therapy is cryosurgery, also called cryotherapy or cryoablation. It is the freezing of cancer cells with a metal probe inserted through a small incision in the area between the rectum and the scrotum, the skin sac that contains the testicles</p>
<p>Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)</p>
<p>Because prostate cancer growth is driven by male sex hormones called androgens, lowering levels of these hormones can help slow the growth of the cancer. The most common androgen is testosterone. Testosterone levels in the body can be lowered either by surgically removing the testicles, known as surgical castration, or by taking drugs that turn off the function of the testicles, called medical castration.</p>
<p>Chemotherapy</p>
<p>Chemotherapy is the use of drugs to destroy cancer cells, usually by stopping their ability to grow and divide. Chemotherapy is usually given by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer with medication.</p>
<p>Immunotherapy</p>
<p>Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) is an immunotherapy. Immunotherapy is designed to boost the body’s natural defenses to fight the cancer. It uses materials made either by the body or in a laboratory to improve, target, or restore immune system function.</p>
</p>

<a id="stages">
<h2>STAGES</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Stage-1 Prostate Cancer (I):The tumor is non-detectable by an imaging test or a physical examination in this early stage of prostate cancer. Meaning, the cancer has not spread outside of the prostate. Discovery of prostate cancer at this stage is almost 80%, with a 5-year survival rate of almost 100%.</li>
<li>Stage-2 Prostate Cancer (Divided Into IIA and IIB Stages):The tumor may or may not be detectable through a physical examination or imaging tests and still has not spread outside of the prostate. However, in stage-2 the cells have a higher Gleason score and may grow more quickly.</li>
<li>Stage-3 Prostate Cancer (III):In this stage, the cancer has now spread beyond the prostate and may spread to the nearby seminal vesicles. This can include some stage-4 prostate cancers that, while they have other advanced indicators, still have not moved to other organs. As with local stage prostate cancers, the 5-year survival rate is nearly 100%.</li>
<li>Stage-4 Prostate Cancer (IV):This is the last stage of prostate cancer and describes a tumor that has spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, bones, or bladder. For these cancers, the 5-year survival rate is 29%.</li>

<h2>EXPERT TIPS OF PREVENTION</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a low-fat diet. Foods that contain fats include meats, nuts, oils and dairy products, such as milk and cheese.In some studies, men who ate the highest amount of fat each day had an increased risk of prostate cancer. While this association doesn't prove that excess fat causes prostate cancer, reducing the amount of fat you eat each day has other proven benefits, such as helping you control your weight and helping your heart.To reduce the amount of fat you eat each day, limit fatty foods or choose low-fat varieties. For instance, reduce the amount of fat you add to foods when cooking, select leaner cuts of meat, and choose low-fat or reduced-fat dairy products.</li>
<li>Eat more fat from plants than from animals. In studies that looked at fat consumption and prostate cancer risk, fats from animals were most likely to be associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer. Animal products that contain fats include meat, lard and butter.You might consider using plant-based fats instead of animal fats. For instance, cook with olive oil rather than butter. Sprinkle nuts or seeds on your salad rather than cheese.</li>
<li>Increase the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat each day. Fruits and vegetables are full of vitamins and nutrients that are thought to reduce the risk of prostate cancer, though research hasn't proved that any particular nutrient is guaranteed to reduce your risk.Eating more fruits and vegetables also tends to make you have less room for other foods, such as high-fat foods.</li>
<li>You might consider increasing the amount of fruits and vegetables you eat each day by adding an additional serving of a fruit or vegetable to each meal. Consider eating fruits and vegetables for snacks.</li>
<li>Eat fish. Fatty fish — such as salmon, tuna and herring — contain omega-3 fatty acids, a type of fatty acid that has been linked to a reduced risk of prostate cancer. If you don't currently eat fish, you might consider adding it to your diet.Another way to add omega-3s to your diet is by eating flaxseed.</li>
<li>Reduce the amount of dairy products you eat each day. In studies, men who ate the most dairy products — such as milk, cheese and yogurt — each day had the highest risk of prostate cancer. But study results have been mixed, and the risk associated with dairy products is thought to be small.</li>
